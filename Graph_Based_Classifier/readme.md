For an arbitray dataset, if we can efficiently simulate a sample-sample interaction graph structure, it would be possible to apply GAT(Graph Attention Network) to do node classification.</br>
Here we start from KNN graph in the euclidean space, explore a method to efficiently infer an graph structure where extend a classifier to a graph node classification problem.
